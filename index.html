    <h4>Excperinces?</h4>
    <p>
      I have been making web games from the day of Adobe Flash long ago but after flash has been buried by steve jobs,
      I started searching for something similar and since Flash's programming language ActionScript is built upon JavaScript,
      so I got into Javascript. <br>
      I started with a simple horror game since those were the craze at the time called ihate.cat and then particibated in 5+ Game jams
      each one trying to make something I haven't done before one game was a top down mystery adventure game #0141184 another
      a fast paced multiplayer fighting game using waves made by your landing impact from a high jump. <br>
      an rts game with time travel but to be sincere it's not one of my favorite creations 
      then a text based Command Line game trying to figure out the plans of the evil company you are in no graphics
      a black screen with white text and the sounds of your keyboard. <br>
      those are just game development wise I worked on the CMS for the website sportal at the time as a freelance developer
      I got a job as a Front-end Angular Developer at an American compant called EtQ developing the interfaces of thier
      great product Reliance. <br>
      I am constantly learning new things I've used ReactNative to develop a simple news app for the website GarageCP
      and would love to keep learning and expanding my knowledge with time. <br>
      I also have a minimal background in Graphic Design using tools such as Flash and Illustrator
